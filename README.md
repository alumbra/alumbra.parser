# alumbra.parser

An [ANTLR4][antlr]-based [GraphQL][ql] parser for Clojure.

[ql]: http://graphql.org/

## Usage

There are two different parsers â€“ one for GraphQL query documents (as specified
[here][query-spec]), as well as one for GraphQL type system definitions. The
latter ones do not seem to have a specification yet, so the parser
implementation is currently based on the official "Schema and Types" guide
available [here][schema-guide].

```clojure
(require '[alumbra.parser :as graphql])
```

The data produced by both parsers conforms to the specs given in
[alumbra.spec][alumbra-spec].

### Query Documents

__[Documentation](https://alumbra.github.io/alumbra.parser/alumbra.parser.html#var-parse-document)__

```clojure
(graphql/parse-document
  "query People($limit: Int = 10, $offset: Int = 0) {
     people(limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
       name
       friends { name }
     }
   }")
;; => #:alumbra{:operations
;;              [#:alumbra{:operation-type "query",
;;                         :metadata {:row 0, :column 0, :index 0},
;;                         :operation-name "People",
;;                         ...}]}
```

The resulting AST will conform to the spec `:alumbra/document`.

### Type System

__[Documentation](https://alumbra.github.io/alumbra.parser/alumbra.parser.html#var-parse-schema)__

```clojure
(graphql/parse-schema
  "type Person {
     name: String!
   }

   type QueryRoot {
     people(limit: Int, offset: Int): [Person]
   }")
;; => [#:alumbra{:type-name "Person",
;;               :metadata {:row 0, :column 5, :index 5},
;;               :type-fields [#:alumbra{:field-name "name",
;;                                       :metadata {:row 1, :column 6, :index 20},
;;                                       ...}]}]
```

The resulting AST will conform to the spec `:alumbra/schema`.

### Tests

This project uses [alumbra.generators][gens] and [test.check][tc] to verify
parser functionality. You can run all tests using:

```
$ lein test
```
